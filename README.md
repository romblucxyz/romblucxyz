## 🧑‍💻 Who TF Am I?

Hey, I'm **Rombluc** – a self-driven, code-obsessed Full Stack Developer with experience building **everything** from responsive websites to backend servers to Discord bots that actually *do* something.

I don’t just code. I build stuff that works, looks good, and doesn’t crash when someone breathes near it.

---

## 💼 What I Work On

Here's what I bring to the table:

- 🌐 **Web Development (Frontend & Backend)**  
  Clean, scalable, and responsive. I don’t mess with bloat – only real usable UI + solid backend logic.

- 🤖 **Discord Bots**  
  Custom bots, moderation systems, music bots, automations – coded from scratch or improved from whatever mess you’ve got.

- 🔌 **APIs & Web Servers**  
  Fast, secure, scalable APIs. Flask, Node.js, Express – I’m good with what gets the job done.

- 🛠️ **Custom Scripts & Tools**  
  Need something niche? Something hacky? Something clever? I build custom solutions that fit exactly what you need.
